## üìò **What is Phishing Analysis?**

**Phishing Analysis** is the investigation of suspicious emails to determine if they‚Äôre crafted to trick users into revealing sensitive information or executing malware. This involves analyzing metadata, links, files, and content for signs of deception or malicious behavior.

## üß™ **Phishing Analysis Process**

| **Step** | **Action**                                                                 |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Collect Email Sample** | Export the email as `.eml` or `.msg` format.                     |
| **2. Analyze Email Headers** | Review sender IP, Return-Path, SPF/DKIM/DMARC status.             |
| **3. Examine Body Content** | Check tone, language, branding, and urgency.                      |
| **4. Hover Over URLs** | Reveal if the actual link mismatches the display text.           |
| **5. Scan URLs and Files** | Use VirusTotal or a sandbox to examine behavior.               |
| **6. Decode Obfuscated Data** | Use CyberChef to decode base64, hex, or encoded scripts.         |
| **7. Extract Indicators** | Note malicious domains, IPs, file hashes, and sender addresses. |
| **8. Respond and Report** | Block in firewall/EDR, raise ticket, and alert users.             |
